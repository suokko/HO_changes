Bugfixes

P D Bug description
------------------------------------------------------
5 ? Klicking through many different matches (50+) in the "Matches" tab slows down HO til it becomes unusable
    Reason: StackOverflowError (we don't know the exact code point, yet)
            Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.StackOverflowError
                 at sun.awt.image.ImageWatched$WeakLink.isWatcher(ImageWatched.java:84)
                 ...
                 at sun.awt.image.ImageWatched$WeakLink.isWatcher(ImageWatched.java:84)
                 (message repeats several thousand times...)
3 A A long teamname confuses the layout of the simulation window (TA) so that many values become unreadable
1 ? HO misses training for player of either the friendly or the league match
	Reason (probably): if the user downloads data right after a match seems finished,
			it was actually not really finished on HT (no cards/goals visible at players,...).
			HO got no valid XML (in progress), but the match short info incl. the result was available.
			HO seems not to load this matchs data upon the next connection in such cases and
			it will be missing at the training calculation.
5 ? Adding a prediction offset for a certain skill can lead to a lower(!) star value
    Reason: Skills<=7 with subskill==offset==0 will be calculated with subskill=0.5...
            If such a player gets training or a manual offset < 0.5, the star value decreases...
            Perhaps we should change that...
2 ? Tactic strength is wrong after loading a lineup with a configured tactic type
3 ? Set 2 fraction digits by default (because we have set maxSubskill from 0.94 to 0.99 now)
    What shall we do, if the user sets the fraction digits to 1?
    A subskill >0.94 will be shown as pseudo skillup...
3 A NPE in Aufstellung.getLeftAttackRating():535, maybe because of special lineups (like 4-4-1)
4 A The old youth school is excellent and in HO, in Misc tab there is passable youth school
	Reason: bug from HT, many/all old youth systems are level 6 now. Notified CHPPs.
3 F Fix HO.sh for linux (remove dependency to bash, accept whitespaces in path name)
5 ? L10N: Some strings in the options window ("Future Weeks"...)
3 ? TA doesn't show up after successful installation
3 ? IFA doesn't show up after successful installation
5 ? Remove/hide unneccessary doubled columns from PlayerOverview/Lineup (name & shirtnumber are shown 2 times)
4 ? Add string and icon for regainer


Enhancements
============
P D Task

2 F Update calculation of special tactics after the latest playerstrength optimisations
3 F Add new market value data from the feedback plugin to HO

4 ? Add a new config option for the default state of the "download matches/schedule" checkboxes on the download dialog
5 ? Add player agreeability to TransferScout

Fixed
=====
P D Task
------------------------------------------------------
2 F Training speed is wrong in some rare cases: from 0.11 to 0.03 whithin a week without any reason
    (same training type, no injury, no card, no 50% training position, same age)
    Reason: player would have reached subskill >1 which gets reduced to 0.94 by HO
    		Perhaps we should change that too ^^
2 A Transferscout parser adds injuries, if a player is warned (red card)

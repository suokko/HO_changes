Bugfixes
========
P D Bug description
------------------------------------------------------
2 A Transferscout parser adds injuries, if a player is warned (red card)
5 ? Klicking through many different matches (50+) in the "Matches" tab slows down HO til it becomes unusable
3 A A long teamname confuses the layout of the simulation window (TA) so that many values become unreadable
1 ? HO misses training for player of either the friendly or the league match
5 ? Adding a prediction offset for a certain skill can lead to a lower(!) star value
    Reason: Skills<=7 with subskill==offset==0 will be calculated with subskill=0.5... 
            If such a player gets training or a manual offset < 0.5, the star value decreases... 
            Perhaps we should change that...
2 ? Tactic strength is wrong after loading a lineup with a configured tactic type
2 ? Training speed is wrong in some rare cases: from 0.11 to 0.03 whithin a week without any reason
    (same training type, no injury, no card, no 50% training position, same age)
3 A NPE in Aufstellung.getLeftAttackRating():535, maybe because of special lineups (like 4-4-1)
4 A The old youth school is excellent and in HO, in Misc tab there is passable youth school
3 F Fix HO.sh for linux (remove dependency to bash, accept whitespaces in path name)
5 ? L10N: Some strings in the options window ("Future Weeks"...)
3 ? TA doesn't show up after successful installation
3 ? IFA doesn't show up after successful installation

P D Bug description
------------------------------------------------------
1 ? HO misses training for player of either the friendly or the league match
	Reason (probably): if the user downloads data right after a match seems finished,
			it was actually not really finished on HT (no cards/goals visible at players,...).
			HO got no valid XML (in progress), but the match short info incl. the result was available.
			HO seems not to load this matchs data upon the next connection in such cases and
			it will be missing at the training calculation.
2 F Subskills are gone after a correct HO update (while keeping the DB) for some users
2 ? Tactic strength is wrong after loading a lineup with a configured tactic type
3 A A long teamname confuses the layout of the simulation window (TA) so that many values become unreadable
3 A NPE in Aufstellung.getLeftAttackRating():535, maybe because of special lineups (like 4-4-1)
    We need an affected DB to further examine the problem
3 ? Klicking through many different matches (50+) in the "Matches" tab slows down HO til it becomes unusable
    Reason: StackOverflowError (we don't know the exact code point, yet)
            Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.StackOverflowError
                 at sun.awt.image.ImageWatched$WeakLink.isWatcher(ImageWatched.java:84)
                 ...
                 at sun.awt.image.ImageWatched$WeakLink.isWatcher(ImageWatched.java:84)
                 (message repeats several thousand times...)
3 ? TA doesn't show up after successful installation
3 ? IFA doesn't show up after successful installation
3 F Remove dependency of HO1 project to hoplugins.Commons - HO itself should not depend on any plugin
    (this breaks the build process for new dev environments)
4 F Apply some GUI changes to make subskill > 0.94 look better with fraction digits<2
4 ? Add string and icon for regainer
4 A The old youth school is excellent and in HO, in Misc tab there is passable youth school
	Reason: bug from HT, many/all old youth systems are level 6 now. Notified CHPPs.
4 F Fix HO.sh for linux (accept whitespaces in path name)
5 F Add a debug level option to HO.sh or - even better - to HO's config options
5 ? L10N: Some strings in the options window ("Future Weeks"...)
5 ? Remove/hide unneccessary doubled columns from PlayerOverview/Lineup (name & shirtnumber are shown 2 times)
5 ? Adding a prediction offset for a certain skill can lead to a lower(!) star value
    Reason: Skills<=7 with subskill==offset==0 will be calculated with subskill=0.5...
            If such a player gets training or a manual offset < 0.5, the star value decreases...
            Perhaps we should change that...


Enhancements
============
P D Task
------------------------------------------------------
2 F Update calculation of special tactics after the latest playerstrength optimisations
3 F Optimize EPV
4 ? Add a new config option for the default state of the "download matches/schedule" checkboxes on the download dialog
5 ? Automatically set the "Away derby" option in the lineup tab, if the next match is such a game
5 ? Add player agreeability to TransferScout


Features
========
P D Task
------------------------------------------------------
4 A HO! version for U3-USB stick
4 A Add connection test utility
5 ? Add optional(!) delayed training popup (like Hattrick Buddy)
5 A Show weather SEs in match highlights
5 F Add a player export function (CSV)


Fixed/Resolved
==============
P D Task
------------------------------------------------------
2 F Training speed is wrong in some rare cases: from 0.11 to 0.03 whithin a week without any reason
    (same training type, no injury, no card, no 50% training position, same age)
    Reason: player would have reached subskill >1 which gets reduced to 0.94 by HO
    		Perhaps we should change that too ^^
2 A Transferscout parser adds injuries, if a player is warned (red card)
3 F Set 2 fraction digits by default (because we have set maxSubskill from 0.94 to 0.99 now)

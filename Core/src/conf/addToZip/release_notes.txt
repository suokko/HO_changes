- Player subskills
	. Training is now minute based. Correct counting only for matches downloaded in 1.431 or later.
		It is possible to delete your own matches by the db cleanup tool, and download them again by
		archive options in download. After this a full subskill recalculation could be interesting.

	. The skill level effect on training has been adjusted.
	. Skill drops due to age at 30 or above, or at skills of 16 or above is in as a first version.

	. All update restrictions have been removed, including favorite teams.
	. Update will now download the matches to fill out your autofilter request, or the 30 last opponent matches if a manual filter is selected.
	. Tournament opponents are in, and so are tournament matches.
	. Auto filter options are now saved when you analyze, and should reappear that way until changed.
	. Auto filter options for tournament and masters matches.

		. Lineup - the old one.

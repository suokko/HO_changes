HO 1.400 includes a first version to predict the ratings of the new match engine. The quality proved to be quite good at internal tests, but the differences may be a bit higher than for the old engine. Use the prediction offset calculation to get better results and provide feedback in the HO! forum. That way we can enhance the accuracy. Thx!

The 2 most active HO1 developers from the lasst months are on vacation for the next 2 respectively 3 weeks. Thats not planned, but a funny coincidence. It might get a bit silent from HO! side during this time. We expect to have helpful feedback when we're back - especially regardings the new rating predictions.

 Special Note 1:

 To those who did not notice yet: with the help of our fellow user Odicin we
 were able to fix the 3rd party plugins "International Friendly Analyzer" and
 "Flags plugin". Both plugins stopped working after the HT/CHPP change last
 November. If you use these plugins and have problems with the update of new
 flags, make sure to have the latest version installed.
 Check this menu: File -> Update -> Plugins -> Normal.

 Special Note 2:
 ---------------
 Thanks to the work of two HO! users Yusuf and Pablo we can offer "Turkish"
 and "Galician(Galego)" as new HO! language soon. Unfortunately both didn't
 make it into HO! 1.398, we're very sorry! But in the next days both should
 be available using the HO! update for language files.
